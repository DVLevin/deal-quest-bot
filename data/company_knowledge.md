# SECTION 1: COMPANY IDENTITY

## 1.1 Company Overview

|Field|Detail|
|---|---|
|**Official Name**|GetDeal.AI|
|**What We Are**|Expert-driven marketplace for acquiring and selling high-growth AI companies|
|**Primary Focus**|Equity transactions — full acquisitions or partial stakes (20%+) involving AI companies|
|**Platform Status**|95% complete — launching February 2026|
|**Stage**|Pre-Seed (raising $500K-$1.5M)|
|**HQ/Team Base**|Barcelona-based core team (European network focus)|

### One-Liner Value Propositions

**For General Use:**

> "GetDeal.AI is the exclusive, expert-driven marketplace for acquiring and selling high-growth AI companies, connecting premier AI assets with a vetted network of strategic and financial buyers."

**For Investors/Buyers:**

> "Never miss another AI unicorn because you were too slow."

**For Startups/Sellers:**

> "Access investors who decide in days, not months — and get AI-powered growth plans to boost your valuation before exit."

### The Cocktail Party Version

> "We're building the first AI-native M&A marketplace specifically for AI companies. We compress 3 weeks of due diligence into 30 minutes using 10 specialized AI models, and we connect premier AI startups with vetted strategic and financial buyers. Think of it as the exclusive club where serious AI deals happen."

---

## 1.2 Origin Story

### The Problem We Solve

**For Buyers (Investors & Acquirers):**

- 90% of investors miss quality AI deals because they're too slow, not because they lack expertise
- Hot AI startups get 10+ investor calls per week — while traditional VCs spend 3 weeks on due diligence, fast movers close in 48 hours
- Corporate M&A teams spend hundreds of hours on technical due diligence for AI companies they don't fully understand
- "You can be fired for NOT taking risks" — risk aversion is now the bigger career threat

**For Sellers (AI Startups):**

- Founders waste months on mismatched investor meetings
- No clear path to understand WHY they're not fundable and HOW to improve
- Traditional M&A advisory is expensive (4-6% fees) and slow
- Confidentiality concerns when exploring exit options

### The "Aha Moment"

> "We realized the investment infrastructure couldn't keep pace with the AI boom. The market needed a specialized platform that could evaluate AI companies properly AND quickly — and help both sides of the transaction win."

### Key Milestones

|Date|Milestone|
|---|---|
|2024|Platform development begins|
|2025|8-model AI pipeline designed, initial data partnerships secured|
|Q3 2025|Migration to LangGraph/LlamaIndex (2.4x performance improvement)|
|Q4 2025|Platform reaches 95% completion, 2,400+ company database built|
|Jan 2026|10-model pipeline fully implemented, 30+ data sources integrated|
|Feb 2026|**Platform Launch**|

|**Expert-Driven**|Technology augments human expertise, doesn't replace it|

# SECTION 9: OBJECTION HANDLING

## 9.1 Seller (AI Startup) Objections

### "Why wouldn't I just use a traditional investment banker?"

> "Investment bankers charge 4-6% with no speed advantage. We deliver institutional-grade analysis in 30 minutes instead of 3 weeks, AND connect you with buyers who are specifically looking for AI companies. Our tiered fee structure (7%/5%/3%) is competitive, and we provide AI-powered growth plans to boost your valuation before you even start conversations."

### "I'm worried about confidentiality — what if employees or competitors find out?"

> "Confidentiality is our foundation. Your listing is anonymized until a buyer is vetted, NDA'd, and you explicitly approve sharing more. We never reveal identifying details without your consent. Many founders on our platform are exploring options while continuing to run their business — no one needs to know until you're ready."

### "What if I don't get the valuation I want?"

> "Two things: First, our 10-model analysis gives you the same view buyers will see — so you know your fair value range before negotiations. Second, we offer AI-powered growth plans that identify specific improvements to boost your valuation. Some founders spend 3-6 months executing on our recommendations before listing, and come to market in a much stronger position."

### "I'm not ready to sell yet — maybe in a year."

> "Perfect timing for a different conversation. Let us run our 10-model analysis now — you'll understand exactly where you stand and what improvements would maximize your exit value. Then we can create a growth plan, you execute on it, and when you're ready, you'll come to market much stronger. The initial consultation is confidential and no-commitment."

### "What's your success rate?"

> "Our M4 matching algorithm has 90% accuracy on buyer-seller fit. When matches are strong, deals happen. More importantly, we only take on companies that pass our rigorous vetting — we're selective because our reputation depends on quality, not volume."

### "How is this different from listing on BizBuySell or other marketplaces?"

> "Those are listing sites — you post and hope. We're an expert-driven M&A platform with active facilitation. We vet every buyer, match based on specific criteria, provide AI-powered due diligence, and have M&A Advisors who guide every step from intro to close. They show listings; we close deals."

### "We're pre-revenue — can you still help?"

> "Yes — our M7 Founder Quality Score and M6 Technical Moat analysis don't depend on revenue. Many acquirers are looking for acqui-hires or technology acceleration, not ARR. If your team and technology are strong, you have value. Let us assess it."

### "What if I already have interested buyers?"

> "Great — our analysis strengthens your negotiating position. We'll run the full 10-model evaluation so you know your true value, and we can help you navigate the negotiation. If you want to expand your options, our buyer network might surface offers you wouldn't find alone."

---

## 9.2 Buyer (Investor/Acquirer) Objections

### "We have our own deal sourcing team."

> "Your team sources deals. We provide AI-specialized, vetted deal flow they'd never see. Our 2,400-company database and 10-model pipeline surface patterns and opportunities that generalist sourcing misses. We're not replacing your team — we're giving them an unfair advantage in AI acquisitions."

### "We see hundreds of deals already."

> "Exactly the problem. You can't do proper DD on hundreds of companies. We pre-vet and match, so you only see deals that fit your thesis. Our 30-minute analysis means you can actually evaluate opportunities instead of triaging based on gut feeling."

### "Why should I pay for access?"

> "One missed AI acquisition costs more than a lifetime subscription. We had a buyer pass on a company last year that sold for 5x what they could have paid. $25K/year for Platinum access is insurance against missing transformative opportunities — and you get dedicated deal flow, not a database to search."

### "How do you vet the companies?"

> "Every company goes through our 10-model pipeline. We assess technology (is it real AI or a wrapper?), team (can they execute?), traction (is there product-market fit?), and market (is the opportunity big enough?). Low scores don't make it onto the platform. You see verified, analyzed companies — not claims."

### "What's the quality of companies on your platform?"

> "We're AI-specialized and selective. Our M6 Technical Moat Score detects ChatGPT wrappers from real AI at 95% accuracy. We reject companies that don't pass vetting. Our reputation depends on quality — if we sent you noise, you'd stop responding."

### "We only do deals above $X / below $Y."

> "Perfect — that's what our matching system is for. You set your criteria (deal size, vertical, stage, technology type), and we only surface matches above your threshold. No noise, only relevant opportunities."

---

## 9.3 Competitive Objections

### "Why not use a traditional investment bank?"

> "Traditional banks charge 4-6% and take 6-9 months. We deliver AI-native due diligence in 30 minutes, with tiered fees that reward larger deals. Plus, we specialize in AI — we understand the technology, the buyers, and the market in ways generalist bankers can't."

### "Why not use PitchBook/Crunchbase?"

> "Those are databases — you pay to browse data. We're an active marketplace — we match, facilitate, and close deals. They show you information; we deliver outcomes."

### "What makes your AI better than others?"

> "Three things: (1) 10 specialized models, not one general LLM; (2) Causal inference — we find WHY patterns exist, not just correlations; (3) Substitution Risk Score — we predict when BigTech will launch competing features. That's analysis no one else offers."

### "Why should I trust a platform vs a human banker?"

> "You're getting both. Our 10-model AI pipeline handles analysis that would take humans weeks. But every deal has a human M&A Advisor who guides the relationship, facilitates conversations, and ensures nothing falls through the cracks. It's AI speed with human expertise."
