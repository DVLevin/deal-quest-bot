description: "Photo lead creation: extract OCR -> strategist analysis -> memory update"
steps:
  # Step 1: Extract structured data from screenshot (focused OCR, no KB)
  - agent: extraction
    mode: sequential
    input_mapping:
      # ExtractionAgent reads image_b64 from pipeline context
      # No knowledge_base injection - pure OCR

  # Step 2: Run strategist with extracted data as context
  - agent: strategist
    mode: sequential
    input_mapping:
      knowledge_base: "ctx.knowledge_base"
      user_memory: "ctx.user_memory"
      casebook_text: "ctx.casebook_text"
      # Extracted data will be available via ctx.get_result("extraction")

  # Step 3: Background memory update (same as regular support)
  - agent: memory
    mode: background
    input_mapping:
      strategist_output: "result.strategist"
      user_memory: "ctx.user_memory"
